# DS340W-Project
Semester Long Project for DS340W Class


I am taking the GraphCast demo file and editing it to improve upon efficiency by implementing multithreading and multiprocessing on areas where the code runs slow.

Implementation - Running Result is my original code edited for the baseline testing. Modified Implementation is the code editied with multithreading and multiprocessing to improve upon the original code. Results are the results I achieved from the baseline model and the improved code.

GraphCast code is from: https://github.com/google-deepmind/graphcast

ERA5 data is from: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5
